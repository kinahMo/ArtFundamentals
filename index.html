    The red-leafed okra varieties, such as „Red Velvet‟, „Royal Burgundy‟
    (a 1988 All-America Selec- tion winner) and others, are especially
    attractive as focal points or backdrops when used in flower borders.
    Numerous other varieties – often with red in the name - have deep red pods
     and bright green leaves.</p2></div>
